# PUBG-Macro-Assist
*Some macros coded by Autohotkey.祝大家吃鸡愉快*

## Warn 2017/11/15
Some users of my tools said that their account had been banned by the blue hole.(Why they don't ban mine?) 
So, please stop using this tool and thank for your support.

## Usage
1. Download **Autohotkey** from: [https://www.autohotkey.com/download/](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
2. `git@github.com:mgsweet/PUBG-Macro-Assist.git` or download the `.zip`
3. run the `superJump.ahk`(only super Jump macro) or `PUBG_Assist(1080p).ahk`(more macro but  riskier).
4. use Fullscreen (Windowed) to run your game.

### Usage for  `superJump.ahk`
1. Crouch Jumping: All of your `space` click will become super jump, just jump as usual.

### Usage for  `PUBG_Assist(1080p).ahk`
1. Crouch Jumping: All of your `space` click will become super jump, just jump as usual.
2. Autofire: you can use single-fire mode of the gun to fire as the autofire mode, which will make you fire more stable. However the default setting of the game may cause that `B` click will change both the game setting and the autohotkey setting.So I suggest you to set the `shift + B` to change auto-fire-mode in the game to avoid conflict.You can also use `NumPad2` to change the setting in Autohotkey script.You will see the tips, just try.
3. Fast Aiming: aim faster in the game. A nice tool I suggest you to use. But it may cause bug while you aim and jump. If you cause that, all you need is just jump again.
4. Compensation: The most powerful tool I think. Which will help you fire stably. But you need to change the value of it to suit the gun you use. For example, M4A1 and M16's  compensation value is close to 8. Just try!
5. Some hotkey you should know:
	1. `NumPad1`: change ADS setting
	2. `NumPad2`: change AutoFire setting
	3. `NumPad0`: set compensation value to 0
	4. `NumPad8`: compensation value to 8, suit for M4A1, SKS, M16...
	5. `NumpadAdd`: add 1 to  compensation value
	6. `NumpadSub`: sub 1 to  compensation value
	7. `NumpadEnter`: display the compensation value
	
### Usage for  `PUBG_Assist(1080p)_adv.ahk`
add more accuracy compensation value to some guns(M16, M4, UMP, SCAL)

also provide telescope(X4) compensation for those guns.

warn: while specific gun mode is running, the default compensation mode can't work, just try or read the code

Some hotkey you should know:
1. `NumPad0`: set compensation value and Gun setting to 0
2. `NumPad1`: change ADS setting
3. `NumPad2`: change AutoFire setting
4. `NumPad3`: change telescope setting
5. `NumPad4`: M4 and SCAL compensation
6. `NumPad5`: UMP compensation
7. `NumPad6`: M16 compensation
8. `NumPad7`: AK compensation
4. `NumPad8`: reset gun setting and set compensation value to 8
5. `NumpadAdd`: add 1 to  compensation value
6. `NumpadSub`: sub 1 to  compensation value
7. `NumpadEnter`: display the compensation value

## Development
I will try to create some macros to help you fire better.
